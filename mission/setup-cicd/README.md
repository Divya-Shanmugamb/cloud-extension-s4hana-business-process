# Setup CI/CD Pipeline

We will now setup our CI/CD pipeline.

1. Fork the GitHub repository

- Go to the GitHub repository. 
- Fork the GitHub repository

2. Go to the Business Application Studio 

- Go to the SAP BTP Cockpit
- Go to *Instances and Subscriptions* or alternatively to *Service Marketplace*
- Start the Business Application Studio by executing *Go to Application*

3. Open a Terminal in the Business Application Studio

- Go to *Terminal* and select *New Terminal*

4. Clone the forked GitHub repository from the terminal in Business Application Studio

- Go to the *projects* folder in your terminal 
- Execute the command below from the projects folder
- In this command replace <your GitHub repository> with your GitHub repository

```bash
git clone <your GitHub repository>
```  

5. Go to the folder you have just cloned. 
6. Execute the command *cds add pipeline*

7. Open config.yml file that you can find on the left in the Explorer window of the Business Application Studio. Open the directory .pipeline and you will find the file there.
8. Edit the config.yml and add the code snippets below at the appropriate spots. 

- Go to the *general* section. 
- Copy the below code snippet and paste it to the general section

```bash
  unsafeMode: false
  projectName: 'cloud-extension-s4hana-business-process'
  productiveBranch: 'main'
```  
  
- Go to the *steps* section
- Copy and add the below over to the steps section

```bash
  artifactPrepareVersion:
    buildTool: 'mta'
  npmExecute:
    dockerImage: 'ppiper/node-browsers:v2'
  cloudFoundryDeploy:
    dockerImage: 'ppiper/cf-cli'
    mtaDeployParameters: '-f --version-rule ALL'
  mtaBuild:
    mtaBuildTool: "cloudMbt"
```

- Go to the *stages* section
- Copy the below over and add it to the section

```bash
  npmAudit:
    auditedAdvisories:
    # high
      - 550   
      - 593
      - 1184
      - 755
      - 1065 
      - 1164 
      - 1316 
      - 1324 
      - 1325 
    # moderate
      - 535
      - 1300 
```

- Go to the *cftargets* section, uncomment the section and update appropriately

The data can be found in the BTP Cockpit in the *Overview* part of your subaccount. Note that *org* is the org name, not the org id.
